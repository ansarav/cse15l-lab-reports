 <h1 align="center"> Snippet 1 </h1>

 ```
 `[a link`](url.com)

[another link](`google.com)`

[`cod[e`](google.com)

[`code]`](ucsd.edu)
 ```

 * Test 1: 
    >  It *should* produce:  
    ```google.com```  
    ```google.com```  
    ```ucsd.edu ```

    > Show code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test
    

    > Corresponding output: not passed

 * Test 2: Implementation  reviewed week 7


 
 <h1 align="center"> Snippet 2 </h1>

 ```
 [a [nested link](a.com)](b.com)

[a nested parenthesized url](a.com(()))

[some escaped \[ brackets \]](example.com)
 ```


 * Test 3: Implementation of markdown-parse
    * clone + edits ?
    * Run test & result of running




    >  It *should* produce:  "insert here" via: choose VsCode preview or

    > Corresponding output: passed/ no passed( show specififc part jUnit output shows tet failure)

<h1 align="center">Questions </h1>

### 1) Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
