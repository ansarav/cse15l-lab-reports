  * Login with your UCSD info
  * You will have to change your password and wait about 15 minutes to let it "Activate" 
  * Look under **Additional Accounts** to your corresponding class the grayish block is important and personal to you

 <h1 align="center">Trying Some Commands</h1>

* Try the following commands  on *your* computer (without being in your course-specific account) and on the *remote* computer
 > For **remote** computer make sure you start your command with üëâüèæ**ssh**üëàüèæ  
  * cd ..  
  * dir
  * cd <file name> 
  * exit
  * clear
  > These commands help you move from one folder to the sub folder to the sub-sub folders.etc

  
|*Your* Computer            | *Remote* Computer                                |

 <h1 align="center">Moving Files with scp</h1>

 > Think of it like when you need access to a picture yout took of your receipt but now you want to access that picture from another device so you email yourslef because you can log in to email anywhere with any device as long as you have the password to that device üíª

 * Create a file <NameOfFile.java> with the follOwing content on *your* computer (thus  ‚ùåieng6 , but ‚úÖpowershell on terminal):
 > to create a file you need to first open/create a folder 
 
``` java

class NameOfFile {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
  }
}

 ```

* Run: ```javac``` and ```java```
<img src="20.png" width= "100%">

* In same terminal type following command:
```
scp NameOfFile.java cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/

```
<img src="scp.png">


> **Note**: the start of the command is scp  s-c-p not ssh s-s-h, but it will give the same step of asking for the password.
> p.s you just copy pasted the file from A to B computer 


* Now, go *into* **ssh** 
``` ssh cs15lwi22zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu```
* type command ``` ls  ```
* and uuuuu there it is, the file you copied 
* *Now* run file on *remote* computer ```javac``` and  ```java```
> This is like accepting it and making it official on the *remote* computer

<img src="run.png" width= "100%">

  

<h1 align="center">Setting an SSH Key</h1>

when trying to get access to our *remote* computer we have to enter the password each time. So we can use ```ssh-keygen``` to make a **public** key (on server *remote* computer) and **private** key (client, *your* computer)

> File with the ending ```.pub``` are public whereas those that don't have that are private 

> So file ``` id_rsa``` contains the private  key and ```id_rsa.pub``` contains the public key which istored is ```.ssh```

* On *client* computer type the following command

``` ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

* Then it will ask you to enter file you can either just type "enter" or can insert the  path as in ```/Users/audri/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```

* Enter passphrase of choice


<img src="pass.png" width= "100%">

* Extra Step for Windows users ```ssha-add``
  * with ```ssh-add``` user private key will be stored
