## Two testsfrom 652 tsts wher group had diff answers than lab 9   
<br>  

## diff ans = diff bugs 







# Test 1

## How to find tst with diff results ( diff with bash???)

## By looking at actual outpur vs expected output, whichor neither implentation is correct

## For incorrect implemeation one, describe bug 

#### describe bug:
#### w/ details what is wrong with the program
#### wchihc code should be fixed
